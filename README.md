TODAY ASSIGNMENT
Supervisor Coding Challenge

Scenario:

You are an intern working under a supervisor at a tech innovation hub. The hub has 4 key divisions where interns (attachees) are placed:

1. Engineering
2. Tech Programs
3. Radio Support
4. Hub Support

Your supervisor has tasked you with building a basic system that:

* Groups attachees into their respective divisions.
* Allows the supervisor to assign tasks, collect feedback, and score each attachee.
* Uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and conditional statements.
* Allows easy modification or extension of attachees and tasks.

Task Instructions:

1. Using either Python or JavaScript, write a program that:

   * Has a class for Attachee.
   * Has another class for Division or TaskManager.
   * Uses conditional logic to assign tasks, feedback, and score.
   * Displays lists of attachees per division and their performance.

2. Make sure your code:

   * Is clean and readable (comments help!).
   * Demonstrates understanding of OOP and conditionals.
4. Deadline: End of Day

5.Submission:

   * Push your solution to your personal GitHub repository.
   * Share the public link to your GitHub repo with your supervisor.
